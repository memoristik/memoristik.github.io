# Usage Areas & Examples

## Fixed Content

When technical information about products is added to diDb by the manufacturer, it can be used from there when the content of that product will be used elsewhere.

When it is written in Markdown or HTML like {!product name/details}, the content comes through diDb and there is no need to type the same information over and over again. Differences that appear due to misprints on sites are eliminated.

The product owner can also add publicly available data, such as a photo of the product.

## User Lists

Users can also make additions to the content of any topic or product by themselves.

These lists created through {!product name} can also be accessed from outside on demand. Price list, where it is sold, different features, etc.

Users can access them all from one place with a usage like {!product name/price}.

## Filtering

Filtering can be done by combining more than one content.

For example, if there are ratings in the user lists created for "Vendors", filtering can be done for product selection, since the ratings of the vendors of the searched product will come directly from that list.

## Followability

The production/sales stages of any product can be followed from beginning to end. The information to be entered by the manufacturer can be transferred to the consumer.

## Verification

Verification and approval processes regarding a product or subject can be added and viewed by users or experts on the subject. Users can choose their own verification sources and eliminate verifications from people they do not trust. Users can choose their own verification sources and eliminate verifications from people they do not trust.

News verification is one of the major deficiencies in this regard. Verification mechanisms can step in and add the data of published news to the database. News that passes through the verification system as "Fake News, Unverified News, Suspicious News, Taken from another source and not referenced, etc." will help users find reliable sources. Sources that publish a certain amount of problematic news will be eliminated.

## Request Lists

Users can create lists and make requests individually or collectively.

For example, a list under a title such as "Books to be translated" may be considered by publishing houses.

Individual or collaborative requests can be created to be included on diDb. A detailed data set on "Peer-Reviewed Academic Studies on the Climate Crisis" can be requested, and an optional fee may be offered.

Requests for local governments can be collected in one place by the people of the region.

## Sources Used

In any subject, when the resources used in the production phase are mentioned, the products used as resources will also have reference. Economic incomes can be commonized.

## Activity Tracking

Activities suitable for personal preferences can be picked up directly from diDb at the place of residence or during any trip. No need to search separate sites for each individual event.

## Common Lists

Since any IDs added to diDb will be fixed, cross-platform migration will be easier. Since each of the tracks in the playlist has a fixed ID, the same playlist can be used on any platform.

## Data Source

Content on certain topics may be based on information from a single point.

For example, transportation timetables in a city come from the municipality and are available everywhere.

## Following Limitation

People can be followed by filtering only their posts on certain topics.

For example, show only the academic work of a person, or show all their posts but not their posts on political issues.
