# Motivation

**The Memoristik Project emerged for reasons such as finding solutions to some of the problems we have encountered as both users and developers for years, trying to protect our personal rights, using the technology at our disposal more efficiently and increasing the sharing and functionality of the data produced.**

**For these and similar purposes, it is planned to create working groups and an environment, bring together open source projects developed in different fields, make changes in accordance with the use and purpose, complete the missing ones, prepare RFCs and ___introduce a new Internet Protocol___.**

**After the completion of the technical infrastructure and the start of the use of the protocol, it is envisaged that different groups will be established and training and data sharing activities will be initiated on issues such as Identity, Academia, Media, Sustainability, Communication, Reliable & Traceable Resources, and applications will be prepared for the efficient use of the protocol.**

## **Priority Problems**

Many issues that have become habitual and considered as must-haves during the internet using carry potential risks for users, cause problems and make it difficult to use. If we summarize some of these:

- ### Domain Names

    The data on domain names that are not extended because they are paid, time-limited and mostly used by rental method may become inaccessible after a certain period of time. During the period of use, reference links given to this domain name from outside and services such as e-mail used on it will become invalid depending on this situation.

    Country administrations can easily prevent their citizens from accessing these services and data through the domain name system, which is connected to several fixed servers.

- ### Old, Dirty, Unverified Data and Sources

    Search engines have often become insufficient in providing users with reliable and accurate information. Outdated and not updated data has to be sifted and verified by the users themselves. Verifying the source of the obtained information  must also be done by the user as an additional process.
    
    Today's algorithms and AI-supported solutions are still far from solving these issues.

- ### Data Repository

    Data stored on centralized servers may continue to exist as long as the server owners allow it to exist. In particular, user-owned and user-generated data is in danger of being removed at any time. Companies and individuals do not have as much control over the future of their data as server owners.
    
    The best example of this is the dozens of Google services that have been shut down.

- ### User Login Procedures, Personal Data, E-Mail

    Many organizations and companies with centralized servers try to collect as much personal information as they can from users and build their own databases. In order to use these services, users log in with their e-mail address at best, even if they don't have to give out other information. Nowadays, this is becoming more and more the case, and users are forced to log in with their email address to read any article or blog post on any site. Users cannot decide for themselves how this collected personal data can be used. 
    
    Also another problem is that despite alternative and more secure services of communication have been developed, development of e-mail infrastructure has been slowing down for a long time, has security vulnerabilities and is still being used for these reasons.
    (The domain name problem mentioned above also affects the e-mail system).

- ### Followability

    Since many people have to use different systems for different tasks, it becomes difficult for them to be followed and communicate with other users. For example, when users want to follow the work of a person from the academic environment, each environment where the work is located may need to be found separately. Or, in the same way, the developments on an academic subject that users want to follow can be accessed by scanning separate environments one by one. Although some solutions can be achieved with "hashtag"-like applications in a single environment, there are many cases where it is not enough.

- ### Repeated Redundant Data

    Especially in the case of "products", the same data is repeated in every different environment where that product is available. For example, the technical information for a product is re-entered each time on the sites where that product is sold, despite having the same content.


- ### Platform Dependencies

    Some of the data that users want to share with each other forces them to use certain platforms, even though there are different availible options. For example, a shared music playlist cannot be opened on another platform with the same content. Data sets created for everyone's use are limited within the environment in which they are created, and even if they can be transferred to another environment, external contributions cannot easily be combined on a common platform. 
    
    Collaborative work on the same data may not be able to continue in an environment where people feel comfortable.

- ### Data Processing, Authorization to Use, Access Rights

    Mostly Data created collectively by independent, individual persons is owned by different institutions and companies, and the people who created it are not allowed to use it freely. 
    This data, which emerges in different environments and in different ways, has become incapable of being managed comparatively.
    
    What used to be possible at least through APIs is now being blocked by the owners of these environments.
